## Version 1.0 Development Plan

### General Overview

For the initial release, JayPlus v1.0 will concentrate primarily on implementing the booking subsystem. This will include a user interface for customers to schedule services and an administrative dashboard for managing these bookings.

### Technical Architecture

- Backend: Service-oriented monolithic architecture
- Frontend: Independently deployed client applications

#### Frontend Development

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript and consists of two distinct applications:

- Admin Interface: The primary focus for v1.0 is on booking management functionalities required by auto detailing administrators.
- Customer Interface: The primary focus for v1.0 is on enabling customers with service scheduling capabilities.

Technologies Utilized:

- React
- TypeScript
- React Router DOM

#### Backend Development

The backend is implemented in Go and organizes functionalities into domain-specific packages. A Postgres database is used for data storage. For v1.0, the development will mainly focus on:

- Booking
- Authentication

Technologies Utilized:

- Go Programming Language
- Postgres Database

#### Integration

- REST API endpoints for communication between frontend and backend.
- JWT for secure authorization and authentication.

### Features

#### Customer Booking

Customers can access the booking page at `<business_name>.jayplus.app/booking` where they are presented with a 3-step booking process:

1. **Vehicle Type Selection**
2. **Service Type Selection**
3. **Date and Time Selection**

Upon successful selection, customers are redirected to the payment page where the following are displayed:

- Invoice
- Payment Form

If the payment is successful, a final receipt containing the booking details and payment confirmation number is presented.

##### Booking Process

###### Vehicle Type Selection

- **Vehicle Types List**:
  - Displays all the vehicle types that `<business_name>` Auto Detailing services.
- **Description Field**:
  - Provides a description for the selected vehicle type, explaining what types of vehicles it includes.

Example: {Sedan, SUV, LargeSUV/Truck, Motorcycle}
"Any 5-seater sedan, any hatchback, any two-door or mini car."

###### Service Type Selection

- **Service Types List**:
  - Displays all the service types `<business_name>` Auto Detailing offers for the selected vehicle type.
- **Description Field**:
  - Elaborates on the selected service type, detailing what it entails.

Example: {Show Room, Basic, Interior, Exterior}

- Vacuum (Including Trunk Compartment)
- Remove & Wash all Rubber Mats
- Wipe All Over The dashboard
- Power Wash Body and Windows
- Power Wash & Clean Wheel Wells

###### Date and Time Selection

- **Calendar View**:
  - Displays a 3-day range with navigation buttons to move between dates. Each column represents a day and each cell a timeslot.
- **Active and Inactive Cells**:
  - Active cells indicate available time blocks for booking the selected service and vehicle. Inactive cells signify unavailable time blocks.

###### Business Rules

- Each vehicle type has a set of services available for booking.

#### Payment Page

##### Invoice

A card-styled invoice detailing the booking for which the customer is going to pay. It includes information like date and time, booking number, and more.

##### Payment Form

Utilizes a Stripe-based form for payment processing, accompanied by a phone number field for customer identification.

### Admin Panel

#### Dashboard

Admins can visit `<business_name>.jayplus.app/admin/dashboard` to access the dashboard. The admin panel is designed with a side navbar for navigation and a main area displaying the active feature. For V1.0, the only active feature is "Booking Management." On narrow screens, such as a phone, an expandable top navbar replaces the side navbar.

#### Navbar

- **Business Logo**: Represents the business visually.
- **Admin Features List**: For V1.0, only "Booking Management" is active.
- **Logout Button**: Allows admins to securely log out.

#### Booking Management Page

Accessible at `<business_name>.jayplus.app/admin/booking-management`, this page lets admins view and manage current bookings.

##### Page Heading

- **Page Title**: Clearly identifies the page.
- **"Add a Booking" Button**: Allows admins to add a booking without payment.

##### Calendar View

Displays bookings in a calendar layout, showing a 3-day view for mobile and a 5-day view for desktops.

- **Column Headers**: Show the date.
- **Cells**: Display booking details such as start time, vehicle type, and service type.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Allow for date navigation.
- **"Today" Button**: Resets the calendar to the current date.

##### Booking Details Modal

Pops up upon selecting a booking on booking management page, displaying detailed information and a "Cancel Booking" button.

##### Confirm Delete Modal

Appears upon clicking "Cancel Booking," requiring confirmation for the action.

##### Confirm Booking Modal

Appears upon clicking "Book" button in admin booking, requiring confirmation for the action.

##### Business Rules

- Admins can add bookings without payment.
- For bookings with payment, admins must use the regular customer portal.
- Selecting "No" in the confirm delete modal reinstates the previous booking details modal.

# Frontend App

## Structure

The frontend application utilizes React and is orchestrated with react-router-dom v6 to manage routing. The application is divided into two distinct sections:

- CustomerApp
- AdminApp

Each of these sections contains an `<Outlet>` tag responsible for rendering the relevant child components depending on the current route.

The codebase adheres to a clean and logical folder structure, which is organized as follows:

- `src`: The source directory
  - `admin`: Contains the Admin app-specific pages and utilities
  - `customer`: Contains the Customer app-specific pages and utilities
  - `components`: Includes all app components caregorized based on domains they are used in
  - `utils`: Utility functions used across the project
  - `context`: Handles global state for both apps using ContextAPI

## Customer App

The `CustomerApp` serves as the parent component for the customer-facing side of the application. It dynamically renders child components based on the active route.

### Pages

The `pages` directory under `customer` adopts a domain-driven sub-directory structure. As of version V1.0, it includes:

- `booking`
  - `BookingSelectionPage`: Handles booking options
- `payment`
  - `PaymentPage`: Manages payment process
  - `PaymentSuccessPage`: Displays payment success and failure message

### Routes

Routing is managed in the `routes.tsx` file under the `src` directory. The CustomerApp routes are structured as follows:

- `/`: Root that renders `CustomerApp`
  - `''`: Default route rendering `BookingSelectionPage`
  - `'payment'`: Renders `PaymentPage`
  - `'payment-success'`: Renders `PaymentSuccessPage`

## Admin App

The `AdminApp` is the parent component for the administrative side of the application, and similar to `CustomerApp`, it dynamically renders child components based on the current active route.

### Pages

The `pages` directory under `customer` adopts a domain-driven sub-directory structure. As of version V1.0, it includes:

- `dashboard`
  - `DashboardPage`: The main administrative dashboard
- `booking`
  - `BookingManagementPage`: Manages bookings
  - `BookingSelectionPage`: Handles booking options

#### Modals

- `BookingDetailsModal`: Shows individual booking details and the option to cancel a booking
- `ConfirmCancelModal`: Asks to confirm if the admin wants to delete the booking
- `ConfirmBookingModal`: Asks to confirm if the admin wants to book the appointment

### Routes

Routing for AdminApp in `routes.tsx` is as follows:

- `/admin`: Renders `AdminApp`
  - `''`: Default route rendering `DashboardPage`
  - `'booking-management'`: Renders `BookingManagementPage`
  - `'booking'`: Renders `BookingSelectionPage`

## Components

Components directory is organized in a domain-specific sub-directory format as follows:

- `components`
  - `system`: Components that are used across the system, such as buttons, cards and more.
  - `booking`: Components that are used only in booking service related pages.
  - `payment`: Components that are used only in payment service related pages.

### System

- `system`
  - `buttons`: Directory including Button types
    - `ButtonMD`
    - `ButtonSM`
    - `ButtonXS`
  - `navbar`: Directory including Navbar types
    - `NavbarSide`
    - `NavbarTop`

### Booking

- `booking`
  - `bookingCalendarView`: Directory including booking calendar view components
    - `BookingCalendarView5Day`
    - `BookingCalendarView7Day`
    - `PreviousDayButton`
    - `NextDayButton`
    - `DayColumnSelectTime`
    - `DayColumnBookingCards`
  - `SelectListInline`
  - `SelectListItem`
  - `DescriptionField`
