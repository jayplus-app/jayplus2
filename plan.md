# Frontend App

## Structure

The app uses react-router-dom v6 for routing. Routes then renders the appropriate apps.

Each of the app files has an <Outlet> tag inside which will be replaced with the appropiate children based on the route.

Each app has its own directory as "admin" and "customer" directories in "src", and the shared components are in the "shared" directory.

Each app directory has Pages directory inside which includes the components for each page that is rendered. The pages then include the required components from the components directory within the app.

The frontend also uses ContextAPI for global state management. Each app has a context directory, which includes the context and provider.

The utils directory witin "src" includes the utility fuctions used anywhere within the app.
